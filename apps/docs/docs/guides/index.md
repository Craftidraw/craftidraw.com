## Using Craftidraw

Craftidraw is a free, open source whiteboard app. It's designed to be simple and easy to use to display your game assets, concepts, and ideas.
It lets you design items that can replicate how they look in your game environments, but also let you export them into usable code, json, and yaml.

There are a few tools and menus that let you use Craftidraw to its fullest potential.
In the sidebar, you can get started with tools, libraries, tooltips, and export options.
